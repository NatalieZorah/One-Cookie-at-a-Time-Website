## What this is

"One Cookie at a Time" is intended to be a simple little online bakery for a small business based in Kalamazoo, MI. The main idea being to give a place to display what is available on any given day, what is able to be ordered, ingredients lists and any prep information that might be prudent to know, etcetera. 

#### What I am trying to accomplish with this project
The overall intent of this project is to provide a practice space to build my skills as a Full Stack Developer. Specifically where it comes to API integration and the use of Springboot and Java to interact with a database. The hope is to build an application that is both simple and reliable, without sacrificing on functionality or user experience. However, this is ultimately a development lifecycle project as well and as a result will also provide experience along that vein, giving an opportunity to make the fumbles necessary to grow.
### Primary Features:
- Menus for the various confenctions, separated into various categories
- Order form intended to ease not only user experience, but also order management
- Informational cards for each item, including ingredients and prep information

### Future Additions:
- Add support for a small Blog page

## Currently in progress
### Major
- Bulk construction of CSS utility classes
- Skeletal React components without block level styling
- Core design drawing board stage (inspiration gathering and permutation ideas)
### Minor
- Documentation of already completed code
- Update this README.md (ongoing)

## Release Notes
- Addition of core skeleton of front end componenets
# Technologies
## Front End
  ### [React.js](https://reactjs.org)
  The entire front end is built using React components with minimal bootstrapping to keep dependencies low.
  ### [CUBE CSS](https://piccalil.li/blog/cube-css/)
  CUBE CSS isnt a framework, but is rather a styling format for writing CSS and the subsequent HTML to to keep the amount of CSS you write to a minimum. It accomplishes this by putting an emphasis on the cascade, heavily utilizing utility classes and lightweight block level styles to use features inherent to CSS and HTML to their fullest. This results in not only more concise CSS overall, but also more declarative classes and descriptive class names, making documentation more readable as a side effect.
## Back End
  ### [Java](https://www.java.com/)
